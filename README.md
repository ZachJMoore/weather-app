Starter Template
================

This is my starter template loaded with what I usually start with which includes:

* Html configured to use my favorite set of fonts from Google, as well as linked css file and javascript file

* Css configured for use with flex with pre-written code that makes it easy to easily get started

* Backgrounds collected from www.subtlepatterns.com that I could see myself using.

* Folders and general layout of everything is configured for my usual start place for any project


CSS

**Quick Rundown**

I have setup css classes to easily be added and presets for fonts, max, widths, and general padding/margin reset.

**Classes**

These are the current classes which are being updated as I start frequently using bits of code.

* **flex-container**
    
    Sets display type to flex and aligns everything center on all axis

* **column**
    
    Makes flex-container direction into a column

* **flex-wrap**
    
    sets flex-wrap value to wrap

* **flex-column-left**
    
    If column is set, this will align the content to the left. Which I find myself using this combo a lot.

* **space-around**
    
    Instead of center this makes everything layout based on space between

* **full-width**
    
    Sets width to 100%

* **no-padding**
    
    Sets padding to 0

* **no-margin**
    
    Sets margin to 0
    
* **text-center**
    
    Makes text center
